## Inspiration
We would like to build a game that is not only entertaining but is also good and beneficial for the gamers' body. The game should be challenging and interesting to make users to play more games and challenge themselves. 

Thus, we built Pawzzle. It is a game for mind and memory training. This game can help slow down the development of Alzheimer's disease and reduce the symptoms. Pawzzle help preserve your cognitive reserve which is your brain's capacity to think and solve problems. The game includes activities that challenge memory, focus, problem-solving, and thinking skills, which can help slow down memory loss and improve brain function. It also provides a way for caregivers and doctors to track changes in memory and support mental health in a positive and interactive way. The game is enjoyable and can make you committed to over time. 

## What it does
The game allows you to choose different time duration to play the game. The shortest challenge is 10 second and the longest challenge lasts 100 seconds. During the challenge time, you need to remember, flip and match the image. You win if you match all images.  

## How we built it
We built the game using HTML, CSS, javascript. We also used Amazon Q Developer to debug and fix code errors. Thanks to Amazon Q Developer, the codes were optimized and we used Amazon Q Developer to have more ideas about how to add new functions to the games. We used Amazon S3 to store assets and deploy the game through AWS Amplify Hosting. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to pick an idea to build the game. We also needed to learn how to use Amazon Q Developer to build our game faster. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build a brain training game that is beneficial for gamers and entertaining. 

## What we learned
We learned how to use Amazon Q Developer  to write code, optimize code, and fasten the development process in timely manner. 

## What's next for Pawzzle
We would like to suggest new levels and add the Dashboard to store users' scores and achievements
